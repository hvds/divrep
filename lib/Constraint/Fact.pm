=head1 Constraint::Fact

In some cases we can get additional powerful constraints by showing that
two n + kd values are linked in a way that constrains the factorization
of both.

=head2 n = p^5

For example, given:
  n = p^5, p an odd prime
  p ~| d
  a = (p + 1) / 2
  b = (p - 1) / 2 = a - 1
  k = a^2
then:
  1) we will have n + pd = pq^2, so d = q^2 - p^4 for some prime q
  2) n + kd = (aq - bp^2)(aq + bp^2)
  3) So long as aq - bp^2 > 1, we therefore require one of those two
     factors to be prime and the other a prime square.

For p in (3, 5, 7) that gives us:
  n = 3^5, n + 3d = 3q^2 => a = 2, b = 1, n + 4d = (2q - 9)(2q + 9)
  n = 5^5, n + 5d = 5q^2 => a = 3, b = 2, n + 9d = (3q - 50)(3q + 50)
  n = 7^5, n + 7d = 7q^2 => a = 4, b = 3, n + 16d = (4q - 147)(4q + 147)

So we should search by choosing successive primes r, and for each one:
  (try r^2 = aq + bp^2)
    - reject if r^2 - bp^2 is not divisible by a
    - construct q = (r^2 - bp^2) / a
    - reject if q is not prime
    - reject if aq - bp^2 (== r^2 - 2bp^2) is not prime
    - construct d = q^2 - p^4
    - n + pd, n + kd are now satisfied, try the rest
  (try r^2 = aq - bp^2)
    - reject if r^2 + bp^2 is not divisible by a
    - construct q = (r^2 + bp^2) / a
    - reject if q is not prime
    - reject if aq + bp^2 (== r^2 + 2bp^2) is not prime
    - construct d = q^2 - p^4
    - n + pd, n + kd are now satisfied, try the rest

If r' is the next prime after r, we need to be sure that the higher
value from r will not be accepted in preference to the lower value from r'
if the latter is the smaller. For that we need r'^2 - bp^2 > r^2 + bp^2, or
(r'+r)(r'-r) > 2bp^2. Since r' >= r + 2, it is sufficient to require
r > (bp^2 - 2) / 2 which means requiring d > ((b^2.p^4/4 + 1) / a)^2 - p^4
before allowing this strategy to be used. For p in (3, 5, 7) that gives:
  p = 3: a = 2, b = 1, require d > (85/8)^2 - 81 = 31
  p = 5: a = 3, b = 2, require d > (626/3)^2 - 625 = 42,916
  p = 7: a = 4, b = 3, require d > (21613/16)^2 - 2401 = 1,822,293

We also need aq - bp^2 > 1, so d > ((1 + bp^2)^2)/a^2 - p^4, giving:
  p = 3: a = 2, b = 1, require d > 25 - 81 = -56
  p = 5: a = 3, b = 2, require d > 289 - 625 = -336
  p = 7: a = 4, b = 3, require d > 1369 - 2401 = -1032
.. so no actual constraint there.

Specifically when p=3, there are further connections which lead to
a contradiction:
  a = 2, b = 1, so n + 4d = (2q - 9)(2q + 9);
  r^2 cannot be 2q + 9, since that would require q to be even, so r^2 = 2q - 9;
  so q == 2 mod 3;
  now n + d = (q + 9 - 3r)(q + 9 + 3r); since both factors are == 2 mod 3,
  neither can be a square, so we cannot have tau(n + d) = 6.
This gives us the C<[243, 4]> exception in Type::TauSeq::check_exceptions.

=head2 198

For g(198, 12), find_fixed() finds that n + 10 d = 8 p^2; we then find
5(n + 11d) = 11 . (2p + 3)(2p - 3) = 11st.

Assume m_5 is the principal value of p (mod 5), and m_11 the same (mod 11).
We then have a variety of possibilities: m_5 is constrained to be 1 or 4;
if m_11 \in (4, 7) then one or other factor is also divisible by 11; in that
case we need st = 55qr, with q and r prime, and m_5 and m_11 will tell us
which factor is divisible by 5 and which by 11 (possibly both the same).

For m_11 \notin (4, 7) we have st = 5q^2r, with q and r prime; since
s and t differ by 6, clearly they are both odd, and whichever is 1 (mod 4)
must be the square. Again, m_5 will tell us where the factor of 5 is,
and m_5 and m_11 together will tell us which must include the square.

=head2 2401

For g(2401, 3), secondary fix_power finds that we must satisfy the Pell
equation C< 4x^2 - y^2 = 2401 >; but considering possibilities C<(mod 2)>
shows immediately that no solution is possible.

(Future handling of Pell equations may make it possible to discover this
sort of thing automatically.)

=head2 p^4

p^4 + 4 = (p^2 - 2p + 2)(p^2 + 2p + 2)

For track(625, f) for f > 4, we find v_0 = p^4, p > 5, and we need
tau(v_4) = 4. However p^4 + 4 is divisible by 5 for all p > 5, and
both of the factors above are > 5 for p > 5, so we must have tau > 4.
